I created this project while following a group study at telegram in 2020, it shows how I use storybook to isolate components.

To install dependencies, use `yarn`.

To run the project itself, use `yarn dev` and open `localhost:3000` in the browser.

To run the storybook, run `yarn stody` and open `localhost:6006` in the browser.

Thanks @derekstavis for teaching me how to use Storybook back in 2016.
